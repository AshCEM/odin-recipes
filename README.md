My Odin recipe list.
This is a project derived from The Odin Project. Here I'm making a recipe list of what ever comes to mind, in this case it's pancakes, hash browns, and sausage breakfast casserole. A wonderful breakfast combo.

Ever wanted homemade fluffy pancakes made from scratch at home? Maybe some hash browns on the side. Oh, how about a breakfast casserole. Now here's your chance to make these fun recipes at home!

Thoughts:
The process was long but worth it. I understand now how to add files into the index.html file from separate folders. I made sure to commit every step. Well not every step... None the less everything is in order as it should be.
