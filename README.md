My Odin recipe list.
This is a project derived from The Odin Project. Here I'm making a recipe list of what ever comes to mind, in this case it's pancakes, hash browns, and sausage breakfast casserole. A wonderful breakfast combo.

Ever wanted homemade fluffy pancakes made from scratch at home? Maybe some hash browns on the side. Oh, how about a breakfast casserole. Now here's your chance to make these fun recipes at home!
